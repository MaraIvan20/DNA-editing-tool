 DNA-editing-tool
 
 I created a DNA editing tool consisting of a set of functions that can be used to load and edit nucleic acid sequences.
 
 Repository contents:
 
 dna.py            : the DNA editing tool
 dna2protein.csv   : database of possible aminoacids
 BRCA1.fna         : BRCA1 gene sequence file for general testing
 chr22.fna         : chromosome 22 sequence file for efficiency testing
